# AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam - April 2020

I thought I'd share the material I used to study for the SAA-C01 exam with anyone who might benefit from it.
  - I passed with 901/1000 score.
  - This material also covers the SAA-C02 exam.
  - Things marked with :fire: I highly recommend and helped me the most.

## Some notes
- AWS has extended the retirement date of the SAA-C01 exam until July 1st, 2020 and is currently offering online proctoring through Pearson VUE for all AWS certification exams.
- The exam is 65 questions, multiple choice / multiple answer, short to the point questions (1-3 sentences). Don't expect paragraph long type questions.
- Don't expect any diagrams or pictures. It's words only.
- Pay attention to keywords such as cost-effective, high-availablity, most reliable, most secure, etc. A lot of questions contained answers that could all work but only one answer fit the question based on keywords.

Good luck! Let me know if you have questions! :sunglasses:
